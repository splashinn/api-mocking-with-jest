# API Testing using Jest

### Testing async API calls using mocking features w/ Jest

Why?

- Mocking is faster. You don't have to wait for the API response and you don't have to deal with rate limits.
- It makes your tests pure, meaning whether they fail or pass depends only on your code, not the data the API returns.

### Set project up

- `git clone` this repo
- `cd` into directory
- `yarn install`

### Run the application

- `yarn start`
  - this will load a view with my GitHub profile information (an API response!)

### Run the tests

- `yarn test`
